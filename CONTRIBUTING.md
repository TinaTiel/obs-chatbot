### Diagrams
You can use Draw.io to save/edit SVG files, and commit them directly to the wiki
repository. You can them reference them in markdown files like normal images.

Since GitHub has both folks using light-mode and dark-mode in their browsers, please
ensure you use a color scheme that works well with both. This typically would be:
 - Orange colors
 - Drop Shadows

You can also use no-fill shapes to better center/bound the image when displayed.
