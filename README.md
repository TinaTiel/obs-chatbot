# OBS Chat Bot
Stream via Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)?

Want to allow chat to ruin your stream or speed-run with memes, scene changes, and other integrations?
Or, simply want to automate sequences of OBS, Twitch, and more actions at the press of a button in your stream deck?

You're in the right place! Connect Twitch Chat, OBS, your stream deck (and more) in one place!

# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

You can read the draft documentation in the [wiki here](https://github.com/TinaTiel/obs-chatbot/wiki), and can watch progress in the
[issues](https://github.com/TinaTiel/obs-chatbot/issues) (I create issues to track my work).

If you are interested in early alpha/beta testing or want to contribute, please contact me and I can guide you (some Postman is required at this time).

Suggestions and feedback are welcome, especially in regards to what actions you want to see in the first release (planned are `ObsSceneItemVisibility`, `SendMessage`, and `Wait` at minimum).

You can contact me via _contact (at) tinatiel.com_, or via my profile here on GitHub.
